However, I'll make an honest effort to illustrate the affection that fills me.My world was transformed by the first love stroke at that point. From that point forward, each second with you has been a magnum opus, an energetic mix of giggling, shared dreams, and a solace I never knew conceivable.You enlightens my life like a reference point. 

In a way that no one else has ever done, the way you  makes me feel safe, cherished, and understood.Together, we are making an embroidery more gorgeous than I might have at any point envisioned. I see a future with you, where our affection just develops, where undertakings entwine with comfortable evenings shared by the chimney of our souls.
            
You are my compass, my dream, my eternity love."
